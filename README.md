# Fancy Python Slides

I was asked to improve this Python program that displays a slideshow of images
which are downloaded from OneDrive. I decided to put my version of it on GitHub
to show the world that I really can finish a project occasionally.

The way you use it is to set your device to automatically sync the OneDrive
folder at some time interval and restart the slideshow script some time after.

## Planned Features

These are features beyond basic slideshow functionality that I plan to add. A
checkmark means I've implemented a certain feature, but does not necessarily
mean I've finished working on it. These aren't all the features the program will
ever have either.

- documentation
- slide transitions ✔
- status bar for info such as class periods
- easily understandable configuration files ✔
- local and remote error logging
- a system to schedule and filter images ahead-of-time
- a system to tailor statuses to specific instances
- a debug screen, kinda like Minecraft
- simple keyboard shortcuts such as toggling the debug screen and halting ✔
