# Fancy Python Slides

I was asked to improve a Python program that downloads images from a OneDrive
folder every two hours and displays them in a constant loop. I'm putting it on
GitHub because I'm just so silly like that.

## Planned Features

These are features I plan to add once I clean up the code.

- robust documentation
- slide transitions
- current schedules and class periods displayed in the corner
- easily understandable configuration files
- local and remote error logging
- a system to schedule and filter images ahead-of-time
